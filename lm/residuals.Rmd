RSS and R


SE, SS total, sigma hat, how they all relate

How do all of these things relate?

residual sum of squares - sum of the absolute values of the errors from the model
RSS

minimize RSS with a cost or loss function

RSS is also called the sum of squares residual SS_residual


---- 


Residual Standard Error - RSE - sqrt(RSS / n - 2)
this is an estimate of sigma


```{r}
library('tidyverse')
set.seed(10)

# create data
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 60, sd = 20)
eps <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 25)
y <- 2*x + 1 + eps

# model 

fit <- lm(y~x) 
summary(fit)
confint(fit)
anova(fit)
```


RSE = 24.32 = sqrt(MSE residual)
SD of data, as described by the SD of epsilon = 25


```{r}
sqrt(591)
```

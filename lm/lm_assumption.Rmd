Assumptions to be met to properly use a linear model: 

<br> 

1. Y is continuous

y is assumed to be continuous.  with very large y, discrete functions basically become continuous. 

Example of Violation: Y = number of coin's flipped as head

How to Test: Self Evident

<br>

2. data points (errors) are independent

the position of one x value does not affect the position of another.

Example of Violation: usually violated by relationships in time or space. 

How to Test: understand experiment design


<br> 

3. X and Y are not intertwined

Y is not a direct function of x, relates to point 1. 

Example of Violation: X = weight, Y = BMI

How to Test: Self Evident

<br>

4. error is normally distributed

Example of violation: ??

How to Test: Plot residuals, look for pattern

<br> 

5. Data is homoscedastic

How to test: plot residuals, look for pattern
